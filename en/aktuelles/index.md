Data transmission at the sites Kienhorst (KH), Paulinenaue (PAU), Booßen (BOO), Dedelow/Quillow (DED), and Potsdam/Golm (GOL) has been restored since July 16, 2025. For Kienhorst (KH), Booßen (BOO), and Potsdam/Golm (GOL), the data gaps caused by the remote data transmission failure have already been closed. For Paulinenaue (PAU) and Dedelow/Quillow (DED), the closing of the data gaps will take place in the coming weeks. A corresponding status update will then be provided.

### 2025-06-26

The cause of the remote data transmission (RDT) failure for the probes KH, PAU, BOO, DED, and GOL has been identified. Fixing it requires on-site intervention in each case. At the Potsdam/Golm (GOL) site, the problem has already been resolved. At the other sites, this is expected to be done by July 2025. We will try to gradually fill the resulting data gaps.

### 2025-06-13

Since June 12, 2025, the probes at the sites Kienhorst (KH), Paulinenaue (PAU), Booßen (BOO), Dedelow/Quillow (DED), and Potsdam/Golm (GOL) have not been transmitting any data. We are working on resolving the problem.

### 2025-05-02

Due to a defective component, the station Kienhorst did not record data from March 17 to May 1, 2025. The problem is now fixed.

### 2025-01-30

The data gap for the Oehna site (mainly December 2024) is now closed.

### 2025-01-27

The monitoring page is now being updated routinely again. We continue to work on closing the data gap that occurred at the Oehna site. For this purpose, the data from the probe's SD card must first be read out locally.

### 2025-01-07

Remote data transmission at the sites Marquardt (East), Marquardt (ATB), and Oehna is running again. We are working on gradually closing the data gaps in the monitor.

### 2024-12-23

We are pausing updates to the monitor for some time in order to fix the described problems with remote data transmission of the measurement signal at the sites Booßen and Golm.

### 2024-12-12

Final workshop of the project "Impact of Climate Change on Groundwater Recharge in Brandenburg: Adaptation Needs and Leverage Points" in Potsdam, together with representatives from MLUK, LfU, and LBGR. We thank the state of Brandenburg for funding the project, which has significantly supported the development of the monitoring network.

Preprint about the CRNS network in Brandenburg published in EGUsphere ([Link](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3848/)).

### 2024-11-15

The measurement signal of the sensors at the sites Booßen and Golm is increasingly affected by noise. We are working together with the manufacturer on a solution to the problem.

### 2024-11-27

FTP-based remote data transmission is suspended due to a DoS attack on the University of Potsdam for the following sites:

* Marquardt (East)
* Marquardt (ATB)
* Oehna

### 2024-11-18

Remote data transmission at the Kienhorst site is increasingly affected by irregular disturbances. We are working on solving the problem, which is caused by weak network coverage on site.

### 2024-06-27

Golm site is instrumented and online.

### 2024-05-21

Monitoring network officially started during a visit by Brandenburg’s Environment Minister Axel Vogel in Marquardt ([Link](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/nachrichten/detail/2024-05-21-dem-wasser-auf-der-spur-bodenfeuchte-netzwerk-brandenburg-startet)).

### 2024-05-01

Currently, six CRNS-supported soil moisture sensors are online as part of our monitoring network in Brandenburg (sites Booßen, Dedelow, Paulinenaue, Kienhorst, Marquardt East, Oehna). Furthermore, we can use and display data from the Lindenberg site (UFZ/DWD).

# Monitoring soil water content

The figure below shows the temporal dynamics of soil moisture (black line: measured using CRNS; purple line: simulated with the SWAP model). The penetration depth of the CRNS depends, among other factors, on the soil moisture itself and is therefore dynamic. For better comparability with the CRNS signal, the SWAP simulation results are also shown as a depth-weighted average according to the CRNS penetration depth.

**Disclaimer**: All values are preliminary. Both the CRNS-based soil moisture estimation and the SWAP modeling are still performed with default parameters. This page currently serves only for plausibility checking and validation of data processing.
